# Unity Character Creation skill pack — v2.0.1

13 Codex workflows for hybrid Unity 2.5D pixel RPG characters. Default `pipeline_mode: hybrid-baked-frames` uses a shared skeleton to author poses, then exports registered layers for pixel cleanup and synchronized runtime frame playback. Supports eight directions and arbitrary action IDs. Start with a complete South slice, then expand requested coverage.

This plugin provides instructions, contracts and templates. The exporter, Unity assets and runtime scripts must be implemented/inspected in the actual target project using its installed Unity tools; they are not bundled finished game components.

## Workflow responsibilities

| Skill | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| master-character | Lock identity, measured proportions, neutral stance and simple fitted base outfit |
| direction-master | Calibrate all requested neutral views without identity or anatomical side drift |
| rig-ready-parts | Produce overlapping modular source parts; separate clothing and hidden patches |
| unity-asset-import | Import authoring sources and final registered frame banks correctly |
| unity-skeleton-rig | Shared authoring bones, minimal skinning and six source equipment sockets |
| joint-skinning-validation | Validate source joints and extrema before baking; localize defects |
| animation-clip-authoring | Author any action; run deterministic baking, pixel cleanup and final checks |
| directional-animation-system | Expand source projections and synchronized final action banks to 4/8 views |
| modular-equipment-system | Item source grips, baked coverage, replacement masks and atomic frame swaps |
| animator-controller | One semantic state owner for locomotion/actions and marker policies |
| runtime-character-controller | One clock for all render passes, movement/facing/sorting integration |
| character-production-qa | Source, raw bake, final frame and continuous runtime evidence |
| character-production-orchestrator | Route work, preserve canonical specs, track revisions and finish requested scope |

## Master and source assets

A new master is a neutral South character with balanced feet, both arms/legs readable, fitted sleeveless top, simple shorts and bare feet. Record the accepted outfit and measured native proportions; do not invent dimensions or regenerate an accepted existing master.

Retain 18 source pieces and the shared 21-bone hierarchy described in [production-contract.md](skills/character-production-orchestrator/references/production-contract.md). They are authoring assets, not a requirement for 18 gameplay renderers. Fix joint gaps in overlapping source art rather than excessive mesh deformation. Equipment sockets are Weapon_R, Weapon_L, HeadEquipment, ChestEquipment, BackEquipment and WaistEquipment.

Source WalkSouth keeps .000 Contact A → .125 Passing A → .250 Contact B → .375 Passing B → .500 Contact A. Physical legs never switch identities and arms swing subtly opposite. Five source keys are not five exported frames: a proposed eight-frame/16-FPS schedule includes all four gait phase keys and omits its duplicated endpoint. Six frames at 12 FPS skip exact passing keys and need separate motion review. Counts alone never prove gait quality.

## Runtime and equipment

Final banks share canvas, PPU, ground pivot, exact sample timestamps, action/direction and layout revisions. One clock computes a frame and applies all required Body/Hair/Clothing/Armor/Weapon pass selections together. Sprite Library/Resolver can select the baked sprites; a single root Animator or state machine controls semantics. Independent layer Animators must not drift.

Authoring bones animate the source. Gameplay renders final frames. A new item can reuse source clips but requires its own actual frame coverage. Upper and lower clothing replacements are independent. Use validated occluder masks or split front/back render passes where weapons/hands/torso interleave; simply hiding other layers while exporting can reveal pixels that should be occluded. Validate against the full equipped composite.

Missing required frames/labels retain the last complete valid selection and report the missing bank. Direction/equipment changes preserve normalized action phase. Timeline markers use crossing detection, including low FPS and loops. Optional VFX/hitbox anchors must have a measured frame track.

Read [hybrid-pipeline.md](skills/character-production-orchestrator/references/hybrid-pipeline.md), [master-design.md](skills/character-production-orchestrator/references/master-design.md), [bake-and-cleanup.md](skills/character-production-orchestrator/references/bake-and-cleanup.md), [layered-frame-playback.md](skills/character-production-orchestrator/references/layered-frame-playback.md), and [action-grammar.md](skills/character-production-orchestrator/references/action-grammar.md).

## Unity connection on every invocation

The official Unity plugin must be separately installed and connected. Every skill invocation, including planning and QA, performs real readiness/discovery through actual installed tooling. Refer to [unity-plugin.md](skills/character-production-orchestrator/references/unity-plugin.md). Do not invent tool names or claim an Editor operation ran from a textual plan. Editing this plugin repository does not require a game Editor; running its production skills does.

## Durable state and migration

Initialize the six specs in the target project, preserving populated files: CHARACTER_SPEC, DIRECTION_SPEC, ANIMATION_SPEC, EQUIPMENT_SPEC, FRAME_BANK_SPEC and QA_CHECKLIST. All templates are in [character-production](character-production/) and mirrored inside the orchestrator skill so they remain accessible when installed.

Follow [migration-v2.md](skills/character-production-orchestrator/references/migration-v2.md) to retain existing masters/rigs/clips and replace gameplay visuals after real banks pass QA. Source edits invalidate affected banks. Installation alone does not migrate a game.

For missing parts, compare source → raw → final → runtime before selecting the failing stage. [missing-parts-diagnosis.md](skills/character-production-orchestrator/references/missing-parts-diagnosis.md) separates source overlap/binding defects from masks, crops, import and runtime selection errors.

## Installation choices

Prefer installing the whole plugin through the repository marketplace; see [Desktop instructions](../../docs/INSTALL.th.md). For standalone skills instead, use an existing Unity project:

```bash
python scripts/install_pack.py --project /absolute/path/to/MyUnityGame
```

For an existing standalone installation add `--replace-skills`; canonical specs are preserved and missing files added. `--remove-legacy` removes only the old `unity-eight-direction-character` skill. Do not mix duplicate standalone/plugin copies without reviewing custom edits. Installation is not an asset migration.

```bash
python scripts/validate_pack.py
```
