# animation-clip-authoring

## Required entry procedure

On EVERY invocation, including design/planning/review, load the installed official Unity plugin's `unity:unity-cli` skill (local name may be `unity-cli`) and make a real fresh readiness/discovery call through its tools. Reading its documentation alone is not a call. Never reuse a previous invocation's readiness result.

CLI bridge example, with the actual absolute project path and THIS skill's name:

```bash
unity status --format json
unity command --caller plugin --skill animation-clip-authoring --project-path "/absolute/path/MyUnityGame" --format json
```

Use equivalent installed Unity MCP tools when available; discover their real names and target explicitly. Require successful live target command discovery before production. Inspect status and discovery together: headless Editors may be absent from status; live discovery is decisive. Diagnose Safe Mode or sandbox visibility before declaring an open Editor absent. If the plugin/project/editor is unavailable, report the specific blocker and stop dependent production; no offline implementation fallback. The plugin is separately installed, not embedded or automatically enabled by this pack.

Then read `../character-production-orchestrator/references/production-contract.md` and `../character-production-orchestrator/references/stage-map.md` (for the orchestrator use its own `references/` directory). Find the Unity project root independently of the pack's location. Read its `character-production/CHARACTER_SPEC.md`, `DIRECTION_SPEC.md`, `ANIMATION_SPEC.md`, `EQUIPMENT_SPEC.md`, `FRAME_BANK_SPEC.md` and `QA_CHECKLIST.md`. These are the durable source of truth; chat requests become recorded revisions. Inspect prerequisites before proceeding. Never overwrite existing specs with blank templates.


Default production mode: **hybrid-baked-frames**. Read the [hybrid pipeline](../character-production-orchestrator/references/hybrid-pipeline.md). The skeleton is an editable authoring tool; final gameplay uses cleaned synchronized frame layers. Distinguish source rig checks from final frame/runtime checks. Read the [motion and bake acceptance](../character-production-orchestrator/references/motion-acceptance.md). A generated sheet is a reference, not bake evidence; validate source motion and trace actual exports before accepting a bank.

## Stage workflow

1. Require validated source direction/calibration/joints. Read [action grammar](../character-production-orchestrator/references/action-grammar.md) and [bake and cleanup](../character-production-orchestrator/references/bake-and-cleanup.md). Accept any stable action ID, not a fixed enum. Record phase grammar, duration, markers, facing lock, interruption/completion and authoring clip paths in ANIMATION_SPEC.md.
2. Author local bone curves against that direction's rest pose using Editor APIs. Melee/cast/jump/roll/death use their own phase sequences; WalkSouth keeps the original five-key 0.5s authoring baseline with real anatomical legs and opposite subtle arms. World motion has a distinct owner.
3. Validate the source clip's joint/curve extrema and intermediate poses. Prove the intended motion in a timed source preview before export. Choose a phase-aware sample schedule: an eight-frame, 16-FPS/.5s walk is a proposed baseline that includes both contact and passing keys. Six frames at 12 FPS remain possible, but skip the exact passing keys and require separate source and final gait review. Frame count is not proof of motion quality; do not append the repeated endpoint. A final one-shot pose can be held explicitly.
4. Implement/run the actual bake tooling in the connected Editor: deterministic pose sampling, fixed orthographic capture, transparent RGBA, identical canvas/anchor/PPU, isolated body/hair/outfit/item passes and saved raw PNGs. Every layer/item variant samples the exact same pose sequence. Record real source GUIDs/revisions, exporter implementation and execution log, plus ordered raw output paths. Do not substitute a generated sprite sheet or fabricate an export receipt. Restore source scene/editor state afterward.
5. Inspect and clean EACH final frame at native pixel scale; remove exposed cut seams, correct silhouettes and preserve canonical anatomy/palette. Do not create unrelated generated images per frame as a replacement for a coherent source action. Use supported art tools, preserving raw and cleaned exports separately; unavailable tools are a blocker.
6. Record final sprites, export revision, sampling, render-pass layout, masks, per-frame grip/FX anchors and evidence in FRAME_BANK_SPEC.md. Import/validate final assets through unity-asset-import. Use continuous layered playback and runtime transitions for final QA.

Output: editable authoring AnimationClip, real raw exports, final cleaned synchronized frame banks and evidence. The default runtime plays frames; it does not deform this authoring rig live.
